CSC 301 PROJECT- SIMPLEX TABLEAU

This C++ program is written to solve a maximization problem with the simplex tableau problem. i.e 
Objective: Maximize 
Z=3x+5y
(Maximize profit or some other objective)
subject to: 2x+3y≤100
4x+y≤80
3x+2y≤60
Final Optimal Solution:
x=0
y=30
s1= 20
s2= 50
s3= 0 (unrestricted)
objective function(Z) =150
It outputs the optimal solution, including the values of variables and the value of the objective function.
